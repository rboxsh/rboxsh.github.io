Rootbox is a tool for Linux and WSL that allows regular (unprivileged) users to deploy applications in a portable and reproducible way.

## How does it work
Rootbox uses Linux kernel namespaces to create contained environments.

## What is the difference between rootbox and Docker?
The focus of rootbox is to provide a tool that can be used to run applications without the need to install dependencies on the host system. Rootbox does **NOT** aim to provide full isolation between environemtns and the host, for such use cases please consider using Docker or Podman.

## What is nedded to run rootbox?
- A Linux distrubtion or Linux on Windows with WSL (Kernel version >=4.18)
- Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11
- Only 64-bit architectures are supported

## What applications can I run with rootbox?

- images from the Linux Containers project ([LXC](https://https://images.linuxcontainers.org/)).
- images from the Docker Hub registry ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/))
